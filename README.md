Toy project to scrape listings on StreetEasy so I don't have to troll their site manually to find apartment to rent. ;)

This is an exercise to try out Selenium and BeautifulSoup and to figure out a practical configuration of a relatively simple web scraper.

Most of the functionality is implemented in [StreetEasyWebScraping.py](code/StreetEasyWebScraping.py)

Todo:

- [ ] moved from Linux to Mac recent, try get this working on new machine

- [ ] migrate to python 3.6

- [ ] add non-embarrassing documentation
