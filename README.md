Toy project to scrape listings on StreetEasy so I don't have to troll their site manually to find apartment to rent. ;)

This is an exercise to try out Selenium and BeautifulSoup and to figure out a practical configuration of a relatively simple web scraper.

Most of the functionality is implemented in [StreetEasyWebScraping.py](code/StreetEasyWebScraping.py)

Update on 2017-07-09
StreetEasy has strated to use Distill Networks to protect agains scraping, I don't think any of these simple scraping tools will work well...
