Toy project to scrape listings on StreetEasy so I don't have to troll their site manually to find apartment to rent. ;)

This was an exercise to try out Selenium and BeautifulSoup and to figure out a practical configuration of a relatively simple web scraper.

Most of the functionality is implemented in [StreetEasyWebScraping.py](code/StreetEasyWebScraping.py). 

Another similar project is https://github.com/dingran1019/angellist-webscrape



**Run instructions**

```python code/main.py``` to execute the scraper, a number of folders will be created



**Update on 2017-07-09:**

StreetEasy has started to use Distill Networks to protect agains scraping, I don't think any of these simple scraping tools will work well...
